# Course Registration System

## Overview

The Course Registration System is a Java Swing-based desktop application that allows students, faculty, and administrators to manage course registrations and student information. 
The project features:
- **Students:** Can register for courses, view schedules, and update their profile. New students must change their default credentials (default password: `student`) at first login.
- **Admins:** Can add, edit, and delete student records.
- **Faculty:** Can view assigned courses and monitor student progress.

The application uses MySQL as its database backend with JDBC for connectivity.
